VirtualTourist iOS App - Project for the iOS Developer Nanodegree at Udacity

The Virtual Tourist app downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app allows users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.

## What I learned

1. To use NSURLSessions to interact with a public restful API, in this case the [Flickr API](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/)
2. To create a user interface that intuitively communicates network activity and download progress
3. To store media on the device file system Use Core Data for local persistence of an object structure
